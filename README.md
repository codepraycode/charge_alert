# Charge Alert Google Chrome Extension
My First Google Chrome Extension

# Story Behind
I'm always carried away with my work on the web that I always forget to unplug my computer whenever it's fully charged. So I thought of a way to get my self aware that my battery is charged and needs to be unplugged, so I thought about building a simple Chrome extension to do that. Also to start building Chrome Extensions, my first ever extensionðŸ˜‹.

# Setup
Setup is easy and straight forward, just clone this repo and Load it in your chrome browser. You can read how to get started with chrome extensions [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/).

# Contributions
Upgrades to this project will be welcomed as I used this to get myself started with building chrome extensions. I'm also looking forward to building more interesting extensions.
